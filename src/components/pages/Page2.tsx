                  I kept showing up with answers when all you wanted was to be heard.  
                  You weren‚Äôt asking me to fix you  you were asking me to stop adding to your weight.  
                  And I didn‚Äôt hear that. Not fully. Not early enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You were overwhelmed emotionally, mentally nd I still made it about ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you like before?‚Äù  
                  I wasn‚Äôt looking at how much of you was running on empty, how long you were giving without being given to.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You were still choosing me, even when you were tired of repeating yourself.  
                  You were patient even when I made it unsafe for your honesty to breathe.
                </p>

                <p>
                  And I know what that does to a person. It makes them shut down.  
                  Not because they don‚Äôt care but because caring starts to cost too much.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>I saw your strength and mistook it for stability.</strong>  
                  But inside, you were breaking. Quietly. Repeatedly.  
                  And I didn‚Äôt slow down to see it. I pushed when I should‚Äôve paused.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You deserved someone who saw the storm inside you and chose to be shelter, not wind.  
                  I know I wasn‚Äôt that person. Not when you needed me most.
